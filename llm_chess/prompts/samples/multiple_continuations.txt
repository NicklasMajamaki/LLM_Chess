Here is the FEN for a chess board, where we start with the 8th row and go down to the 1st row: <FEN>

Here are three continuations of 5 plies:

<best continuation>
<worst continuation>
<random continuation>

Figure out which one leads to the best board for the player (<player>) and then suggest the first move from that continuation as the move to play.
